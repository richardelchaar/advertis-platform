test_orchestration.py

Integration tests for the main orchestration logic of the `host_app`.
This suite focuses on the `get_final_response` function from `app/app.py`,
verifying its interaction with the mocked `advertis_client` and `fallback_llm`
services. These tests are crucial for ensuring the host app's resilience and
correct behavior in response to both successful and failed monetization attempts.
